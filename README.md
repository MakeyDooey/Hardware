# Hardware
This includes all CAD files, PCB designs, schematics, datasheets, and designs. (includes enclosure and modularity components)


In it's current state I do not have a .gitignore for this repo. I will make one eventually and organize the repo more, but for now all KiCAD files are saved in the Schematic Folder as they are saved on my local computer
